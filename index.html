<p id="p2">I was born on the coast of South Carolina, where my parents liked to
vacation when there was almost nothing there at all. My father was in
some sort of middle management position in a large and growing
construction company. They'd built some of the Oak Ridge atomic
facilities, and paranoiac legends of "security" at Oak Ridge were part
of our family culture. There was a cigar-box full of strange-looking
ID badges he'd worn there. But he'd done well at Oak Ridge, evidently,
and so had the company he worked for, and in the postwar South they
were busy building entire red brick Levittown-style suburbs. We moved
a lot, following these projects, and he was frequently away, scouting
for new ones.
<br>
<br>
It was a world of early television, a new Oldsmobile with crazy
rocket-ship styling, toys with science fiction themes. Then my father
went off on one more business trip. He never came back. He choked on
something in a restaurant, the Heimlich maneuver hadn't been
discovered yet, and everything changed.
My mother took me back to the small town in southwestern Virginia
where both she and my father were from, a place where modernity had
arrived to some extent but was deeply distrusted. The trauma of my
father's death aside, I'm convinced that it was this experience of
feeling abruptly exiled, to what seemed like the past, that began my
relationship with science fiction. 
<br>
<br>
I eventually became exactly the sort of introverted, hyper-bookish boy
you'll find in the biographies of most American science fiction
writers, obsessively filling shelves with paperbacks and digest-sized
magazines, dreaming of one day becoming a writer myself.
At age fifteen, my chronically anxious and depressive mother having
demonstrated an uncharacteristic burst of common sense in what today
we call parenting, I was shipped off to a private boys' school in
Arizona. There, extracted grub-like and blinking from my bedroom and
those bulging plywood shelves, I began the forced invention of a less
Lovecraftian persona - based in large part on a chance literary
discovery a year or so before.
<br>
<br>
I had stumbled, in my ceaseless quest for more and/or better science
fiction, on a writer name Burroughs -- not Edgar Rice but William S.,
and with him had come his colleagues Kerouac and Ginsberg. I had read
this stuff, or tried to, with no idea at all of what it might mean,
and felt compelled - compelled to what, I didn't know. The effect,
over the next few years, was to make me, at least in terms of my
Virginia home, Patient Zero of what would later be called the
counterculture. At the time, I had no way of knowing that millions of
other Boomer babes, changelings all, were undergoing the same
metamorphosis.
<br>
<br>
In Arizona, science fiction was put aside with other childish things,
as I set about negotiating puberty and trying on alternate personae
with all the urgency and clumsiness that come with that, and was
actually getting somewhere, I think, when my mother died with stunning
suddenness. Dropped literally dead: the descent of an Other Shoe I'd
been anticipating since age six.
<br>
<br>
Thereafter, probably needless to say, things didn't seem to go very
well for quite a while. I left my school without graduating, joined up
with rest of the Children's Crusade of the day, and shortly found my
self in Canada, a country I knew almost nothing about. I concentrated
on evading the draft and staying alive, while trying to make sure I
looked like I was at least enjoying the Summer of Love. I did
literally evade the draft, as they never bothered drafting me, and
have lived here in Canada, more or less, ever since.
Having ridden out the crest of the Sixties in Toronto, aside from a
brief, riot-torn spell in the District of Columbia, I met a girl from
Vancouver, went off to Europe with her (concentrating on countries
with fascist regimes and highly favorable rates of exchange) got
married, and moved to British Columbia, where I watched the hot fat of
the Sixties congeal as I earned a desultory bachelor's degree in
English at UBC.
<br>
<br>
In 1977, facing first-time parenthood and an absolute lack of 
enthusiasm for anything like "career," I found myself dusting off my
twelve-year-old's interest in science fiction. Simultaneously, weird
noises were being heard from New York and London. I took Punk to be
the detonation of some slow-fused projectile buried deep in society's
flank a decade earlier, and I took it to be, somehow, a sign. And I
began, then, to write. And have been, ever since.
<br>
<br>
Google me and you can learn that I do it all on a manual typewriter,
something that hasn't been true since 1985, but which makes such an
easy hook for a lazy journalist that I expect to be reading it for the
rest of my life. I only used a typewriter because that was what
everyone used in 1977, and it was manual because that was what I
happened to have been able to get, for free. I did avoid the Internet,
but only until the advent of the Web turned it into such a magnificent
opportunity to waste time that I could no longer resist. Today I
probably spend as much time there as I do anywhere, although the
really peculiar thing about me, demographically, is that I probably
watch less than twelve hours of television in a given year, and have
watched that little since age fifteen. (An individual who watches no
television is still a scarcer beast than one who doesn't have an email
address.) I have no idea how that happened. It wasn't a decision.
I do have an email address, yes, but, no, I won't give it to you. I am
one and you are many, and even if you are, say, twenty-seven in grand
global total, that's still too many. Because I need to have a life and
waste time and write.
I suspect I have spent just about exactly as much time actually
writing as the average person my age has spent watching television,
and that, as much as anything, may be the real secret here.</p>
