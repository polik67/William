<p id="p1">The Peripheral <br> <br>
The Peripheral is an emphatic return to the science fiction he ceased to write after the turn of this century, set in not one but two futures. The first, not far off from our own present day, takes place in a Winter's Bone-ish world where the only industries still surviving are lightly evolved versions of Walmart and the meth trade. The second future is set further along in time, after a series of not-quite-cataclysmic events that have killed most of the world's population, leaving behind a monarchic class of gangsters, performance artists, and publicists in an otherwise deserted London. Like many Gibson books, The Peripheral is basically a noirish murder mystery wearing a cyberpunk leather jacket and, after an uncharacteristically dense first one hundred pages, a super enjoyable read—though perhaps less so when you consider just how accurate Gibson can be when he's thinking about what might come next. Because according to The Peripheral, what is coming next is, to borrow Gibson's phrase again, well…fucked.</p>

In an alternative 2016, the US Vice President, Junior Henderson gets a facelift to look like his grandfather, and travels back in time to 1945 with six comrades using a device called the Splitter. When back in 1945 they kill Junior's grandfather, and Junior takes his place. Meanwhile, in 2016 a faction opposed to this plan take control of the Splitter, led by Major Torres, who want to prevent the potential problems that interference with the timeline might cause. Meanwhile, in 1945, RAF Officer, Agent Naomi Givens, is instructed to investigate the appearance of an unknown aircraft that crashed in Berlin, killing one of the two pilots of the craft. She contacts her ex-boyfriend, Vince Mathews, and together they investigate the circumstances of the crash, and attempt to obtain information from the surviving pilot who is revealing nothing.

The surviving pilot contacts Major Torres in the future and obtains a stealth suit that allows him to escape from prison. He contacts Naomi Givens who has discovered that some of the materials from the crash site are from the future. The pilot explains a little bit about the circumstances of his time travel to Naomi before Junior Henderson and Vince arrive to interview Naomi. Naomi claims she knows nothing about the pilot to Junior, and his treatment of her and his general behaviour causes Vince to realise that Junior is not what he seems to be, so Vince makes a break from Junior. Naomi goes to a nightclub to meet a Ukrainian contact who may have information about the crashed plane that landed in the Russian quadrant of Berlin. She is followed by the pilot who in turn is being followed separately by both Junior and Vince.</p>

<p id="p1"> Neuromancer <br> <br>
Neuromancer, a novel written by William Gibson in 1984, takes place in the near future in a cyberpunk setting. Cyberpunk is a genre that focuses on future societies where technology has advanced, but crime and corruption have as well. Common features include globe-spanning mega-corporations, cybernetically enhanced mercenaries, and the importance of technology as a tool for crime. The story follows the experiences of Case, an out-of-work hacker who is contacted by a mysterious new employer called Armitage. Along with Molly, a mercenary cyborg, and a thief/illusionist named Peter Riviera, Case participates in a series of data thefts for their employer. Their first job has them stealing an electronic copy of the mind of McCoy Pauley, a brilliant hacker who taught Case a great deal of what he knows. They steal this electronic mind to help them in performing their next job.

After that, the group must head to Freeside, an enormous space habitat in orbit around Earth. Freeside serves as a luxury resort and casino for the wealthy, and it is also the location of Villa Straylight, the home of the incredibly wealthy and powerful Tessier-Ashpool family. The group's second job is to break into the Villa Straylight and hack into Wintermute, a powerful artificial intelligence created by the Tessier-Ashpool family.

In the end, it turns out that Wintermute itself was behind the whole scheme. Government regulations put careful restrictions on artificial intelligences to prevent them from getting out of hand, and Wintermute was using Armitage and his team to break those restrictions. This allows Wintermute to merge with another A.I. called Neuromancer, becoming a new, more powerful electronic being.

<p id="p1"> Pattern Recognition <br> <br>
Advertising consultant Cayce Pollard, who reacts to logos and advertising as if to an allergen, arrives in London in August 2002. She is working on a contract with the marketing firm Blue Ant to judge the effectiveness of a proposed corporate logo for a shoe company. During the presentation, graphic designer Dorotea Benedetti becomes hostile towards Cayce as she rejects the first proposal. After dinner with some Blue Ant employees, the company founder Hubertus Bigend offers Cayce a new contract: to uncover who is responsible for distributing a series of anonymous, artistic film clips via the internet. Cayce had been following the film clips and participating in an online discussion forum theorizing on the clips' meaning, setting, and other aspects. Wary of corrupting the artistic process and mystery of the clips, she reluctantly accepts. Cayce is not entirely comfortable with Ivy's chat group called "Fetish:Footage:Forum" (or F:F:F), as shown by the following excerpt:

There are perhaps twenty regular posters on F:F:F, and some much larger and uncounted number of lurkers. And right now there are three people in Chat, but there's no way of knowing exactly who until you are in there, and the chat room she finds not so comforting. It's strange even with friends, like sitting in a pitch-dark cellar conversing with people at a distance of about fifteen feet.[5]

A friend from the discussion group, who uses the handle Parkaboy, privately emails her saying a friend of a friend has discovered an encrypted watermark on one clip. They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese man who knows the watermark code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.

Through a completely random encounter Cayce meets Voytek Biroshak and Ngemi, the former an artist using old ZX81 microcomputers as a sculpture medium, the latter a collector of rare technology (he mentions purchasing Stephen King's word processor, for example). Another collector, and sometime 'friend' of Ngemi's, Hobbs Baranov, is a retired cryptographer and mathematician with connections in the American National Security Agency. Cayce strikes a deal with him: she buys a Curta calculator for him and he finds the email address to which the watermark code was sent. Using this email address Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova whose sister Nora is the maker of the film clips.

Cayce flies to Moscow to meet Stella in person and watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an assassination attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal that they have been spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert. </p>

<p id="p1"> Spook Country <br> <br>
Tito is in his early twenties. Born in Cuba, he speaks fluent Russian, lives in one room in a NoLita warehouse, and does delicate jobs involving information transfer. 

Hollis Henry is an investigative journalist, on assignment from a magazine called Node. Node doesn't exist yet, which is fine; she's used to that. But it seems to be actively blocking the kind of buzz that magazines normally cultivate before they start up. Really actively blocking it. It's odd, even a little scary, if Hollis lets herself think about it much. Which she doesn't; she can't afford to. 

Milgrim is a junkie. A high-end junkie, hooked on prescription antianxiety drugs. Milgrim figures he wouldn't survive twenty-four hours if Brown, the mystery man who saved him from a misunderstanding with his dealer, ever stopped supplying those little bubble packs. What exactly Brown is up to Milgrim can't say, but it seems to be military in nature. At least, Milgrim's very nuanced Russian would seem to be a big part of it, as would breaking into locked rooms. 

Bobby Chombo is a "producer," and an enigma. In his day job, Bobby is a troubleshooter for manufacturers of military navigation equipment. He refuses to sleep in the same place twice. He meets no one. Hollis Henry has been told to find him. </p>

<p id="p1"> Count Zero <br> <br>
Count Zero' is the handle of young cyberspace cowboy Bobby Newmark, who runs into deadly ice on his supposedly safe first run. He is saved by a giant angel-like appearance in cyberspace. As he tries to contact his contractor, he is attacked by hitmen and close to death. After being put together again by a surgeon, the group of people behind his contractor take care of Bobby to reclaim the icebreaker which they provided to him to "test-drive". They are also interacting and pacting with yet unknown entities in the Matrix described as 'voodoo gods' or 'loa', which seem to be loose parts of conscious AIs set free after the unification of Wintermute and Neuromancer.

Another person affected by the loa is Angela Mitchell, daughter of world-famous biochips developer Christopher Mitchell. He is supposed to be defecting from his current employer Maas Biolabs to Hosaka, but extraction expert Turner realizes at the extraction point that Mitchell sent his daughter instead. Turner learns that Angela has strange DNA patterns in her brain, which she says her father put there to augment her intelligence. This enables her to access cyberspace without a deck, but the loa are also able to take control of her.

The Maas biochip technology is a hybrid technology based on immortal human cancer cells which can function as circuitry in chips. The biochips as well as Bobby's bioware icebreaker are of great interest to the super-rich Josef Virek, the wealthiest individual on the planet. Virek is confined to a life-supporting vat in Stockholm and hopes to become immortal through the biochips technology. He contracts former gallery owner Marly Krushkova to find the maker of strange art boxes that have appeared recently, resembling the work of Joseph Cornell. Through tracing the boxes back to the shop of The Finn, Virek supposes the boxes and the bioware seem to come from the same place. After a quest involving the death of her ex-lover, Marly traces the boxes to the defunct orbital spa Freeside and travels into orbit to meet the Boxmaker. She finally learns that the maker is an AI that puts together the boxes with the relicts of the Tessier-Ashpool family. 

Meanwhile, the loa direct Turner and Angela to Jammer's bar, where Bobby and Beauvoir are locked in by Maas associates. Bobby manages to contact Jaylene Slide, Turner's partner at the extraction site, who then burns both their contractor and Josef Virek. Bobby also realizes that it was Angie who saved his life in cyberspace. A few years later, Angela is becoming a simstim star with Bobby at her side. This storyline is continued in 'Mona Lisa Overdrive'. </p> <br> <br>
